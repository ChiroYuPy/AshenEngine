# AshenEngine
*A modern 2D/3D game engine built from scratch for learning, experimentation, and real engine development experience.*

AshenEngine is a personal project focused on understanding how a real game engine works beneath the surface. No shortcuts — the goal is to design a clean, modular and scalable architecture, while exploring rendering, physics, audio, assets, and tooling.

This engine is both a playground and an ongoing technical challenge.

## Features (Work in Progress)

- Cross-platform Game Loop & Windowing
- 2D & 3D Rendering Architecture
- Custom Audio System with multiple sound instances
- Modular Engine Core
- Scene System & Hierarchy
- Input Abstraction Layer

Planned:
- Full ECS architecture
- PBR rendering
- Physics integration
- Editor & tooling suite
- Resource hot-reloading

---

## Project Goals

- Build a robust foundation without relying on existing engines
- Learn modern rendering and engine architecture principles
- Provide a clean environment for prototyping gameplay and tools
- Develop an in-house editor over time

---

## Current Status

AshenEngine is in early development. The public API and structure are still evolving frequently.

What currently works:
- Window creation & Game runtime
- Basic 2D/3D rendering pipeline
- Audio playback with concurrency

In development:
- Scene system overhaul
- Tooling support
- Rendering improvements

## Architecture Overview

Core systems include:

- **Core**: Application runtime, game loop, platform layer
- **Renderer**: Rendering pipeline, batching, shaders
- **Assets**: Resource loading & management
- **Audio**: Playback engine with support for multiple instances
- **Input**: Unified keyboard/mouse events
- **Scene**: Entity hierarchy, transforms

Each module is built to evolve independently.
