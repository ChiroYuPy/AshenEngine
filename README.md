# AshenEngine

AshenEngine is an open development 2D/3D game engine project focused on clarity, modularity, and long-term educational value.  
The goal is to explore and implement modern game engine architecture while providing a clean foundation for future tools and gameplay systems.

This project is currently under active development.

---

## Key Features

- Cross-platform windowing and game loop
- Rendering pipeline for both 2D and 3D
- Audio playback system with multiple sound instances
- Input abstraction (keyboard, mouse)
- Scene and transform hierarchy

Planned additions include:

- Complete ECS architecture
- Physics engine integration
- Editor and development tooling
- Asset hot-reloading
- Advanced rendering (lighting, materials)

---

## Status

AshenEngine is in an early stage. Systems and APIs may change without notice.

Core systems available:
- Runtime + platform initialization
- Basic rendering functionality
- Audio subsystem foundations

In progress:
- Scene system refactor
- Renderer improvements
- Tooling pipeline research

## Project Structure

- **Core**: Application, timing, runtime, platform abstraction
- **Renderer**: Graphics pipeline, batching, shader management
- **Audio**: Device control and sound instance management
- **Input**: Event handling and input mapping
- **Scene**: Entities, transforms, hierarchical organization
- **Assets**: Resource loading (planned expansion)

Each module is isolated to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Building

Build instructions will be documented once the structure stabilizes.

---

## Contributing

While the project is primarily personal at this stage, feedback and discussion are welcome.  
Issue reports, ideas, or technical suggestions can be shared via the repository once publicly available.
